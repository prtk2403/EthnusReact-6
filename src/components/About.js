        Welcome to my portfolio website. I am a dedicated Computer Science
        student pursuing Btech 3rd Year. Over the past years, I've been honing
        my skills and exploring the fascinating world of technology. My journey
        in CSE has equipped me with a strong foundation in various programming
        languages, data structures, and algorithms.
